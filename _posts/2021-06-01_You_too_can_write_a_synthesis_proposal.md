# You too can write a Synthesis Proposal

![meme_make_synthesis_proposal](../assets/meme_make_synthesis_proposal.jpg)

One of the main goals of the Exploratories is to make use of the wealth of data collected by projects working on the same plots. The instrument to do so is synthesis. Did you know, that if you are using data from three or more different projects, you are already conducting a synthesis project?



In order to announce your project to the rest of the Exploratories, please create a synthesis proposal. To do so, send a tentative title of the paper, the key hypothesis, a preliminary list of authors and information about when and /how they will be involved, and the anticipated journal to the BEO, which will distribute it via the internal BE mailing list. You can use the following [template](https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/FMT/GeneralFiles/DownloadFile?path=FMT%5C%5CBeoInformation%5C%5CSynthesisProposal%5C%5CSynthesis%20proposal%20000%20TEMPLATE%20-%20NEW%20%282017%29.docx&mimeType=.docx). You can find [all former synthesis proposals](https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/FMT/GeneralFiles/Show?viewTitle=General%20Documents&viewName=GeneralFiles&rootMenu=BeoInformation) in BExIS  under Synthesis Proposals.



Synthesis proposals are distributed among all explorers, and they are key to furthering new collaborations and to check potential overlap with other ongoing projects (any overlaps can be resolved by discussion and potentially slightly refocusing the synthesis if necessary). 



If you are using data from less than three projects, i.e. you just want to use one or two variables, then it is better to get in touch with the original data owners and use the individual datasets. The synthesis datasets are most useful if you want to use data from many projects.



If you want support for your synthesis project, or with the use of synthesis datasets, the synthesis helpdesk will be very happy to help you! You can contact us at the following addresses: [noelle.schenk@ips.unibe.ch](mailto:noelle.schenk@ips.unibe.ch), [caterina.penone@ips.unibe.ch](mailto:caterina.penone@ips.unibe.ch).
