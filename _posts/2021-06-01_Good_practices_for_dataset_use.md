# Good Practices for dataset use

![meme_use_latest_datasets](../assets/meme_use_latest_datasets.jpg)

One of the privileges of being part of the Biodiversity-Exploratories is the opportunity to have access to the most recent datasets, which are still under embargo for public use. This is possible because we have a common philosophy of data sharing (ROP*), which benefits data contributors and users alike.



As a data user you benefit from including the most recent datasets in your analysis because then you can be sure that you have the most complete data – both in terms of number of years and number of species and trophic groups. This allows you to do more powerful analyses and get even more general answers to your questions. In some cases, revision of data also reveals errors, or clarifies issues, so the latest datasets are likely to be more accurate and easier to use. Also, the sampling techniques are constantly improving, so using the most recent datasets means relying on the most recent techniques. 
 

In the Biodiversity Exploratories, we agreed to offer co-authorship to data collectors to acknowledge the large amount of work they invested in data collection. At the same time, data collectors are specialists in the data they have collected: they know about their peculiarities and their limits, they have analysed and interpreted the data before and they are best able to provide background to understand what the data are telling us. Data owners are the best reference to answer any doubts you may have, and in many cases are also to judge if their data can be used in the way you are planning. They can make a highly valuable contribution to the analysis and we depend on them to check that the data are used appropriately, not including their opinion would be a loss.



Thus, by offering co-authorship, we don’t only acknowledge the work invested in data collection, but also in the revision and quality control of the manuscript itself. Further, comments from many authors generally lead to stronger and more robust papers because many people have reviewed the paper even before it is sent out to review by a journal.



There are many ways of communicating with each other in the Exploratories and one important way is collaboration. By using the most recent datasets, we further active communication with each other, and thereby strengthen our network. Even though handling comments from many co-authors can be challenging, it allows us to practice our social skills, our ability to work in a team and builds our scientific network, all things that are especially valuable for early career researchers. 



Are you wondering how to find out whether there is a new dataset which could be relevant for your research?

- Have a look at the BExIS newsletter “Changed datasets”, which announces uploads of new datasets and changes to existing ones.
- Read the manuscripts which are sent around and check the data that has been included or browse through the research project presentations from the last Assembly.
- Use the nice new search tool in BExIS 2
- Check the synthesis datasets and what is included in them.
   

Procedure to request data:

- - Send your request via BExIS 2, explaining the planned usage of the data. The contact person of the requested dataset needs to respond within 2 weeks (if not indicated otherwise by e.g. absence notification).
  - The whole process is described in the ROP*
